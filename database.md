## PODS

Pipeline Open Data Structure - a relational data model devised for implementing on RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) platform like Microsoft SQL Server. 

[What is the PODS Pipeline Data Model?](http://www.pods.org/pods-model/what-is-the-pods-pipeline-data-model/)

## Basics

To make execution time shorter (disable statistics which are printed on the console):
`SET NOCOUNT ON;`

@ID means it's a parameter that you will supply a value for later in your code.

`a != b`
is equivalent to
`a <> b`

`WHERE name IN ('x', 'y', 'z', etc.)`
